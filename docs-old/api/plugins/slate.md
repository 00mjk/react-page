## transformChildren

[packages/plugins/content/slate/lib/utils/transformInitialSlateState.js:32-60][3]

FIXME: transformInitialSlateState does some polymorphic type magic, so that it is directly
compatible with the shipped default plugins or plugins created with pluginFactories

This is a bit ugly and might be hard to understand,
but on the other hand its easy to use for developers that use this library

Basicaly what we do is to unpack the factory or its result until we find

-   object: "block" | "inline" | "mark"
-   type: "SOMESTRING"

We might revisit this in the future.
